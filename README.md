# 🧰 All-in-One Project - C++ Console Application

## 📌 Overview
**All-in-One Project** is a comprehensive console-based C++ program that collects multiple beginner–intermediate exercises in one place.  
It was designed during the early stages of my programming journey in **2023** as a practical project to enhance my skills in **arrays, loops, conditionals, functions, and menu-driven programs**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Menu-driven interface with multiple "lecture" sections.
- ✅ Covers basics: input/output, arithmetic, and conditionals.
- ✅ Loop-based exercises: counting, factorials, tables, patterns.
- ✅ Array operations: search, delete, sort, reverse, sum, etc.
- ✅ Matrix operations: diagonals, transpose, identity matrix.
- ✅ Functions module: recursion, overloading, pass-by-reference.
- ✅ Restart or exit options from main menu.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C++** as the main programming language.
- `<iostream>` for input/output.
- `<windows.h>` for `Sleep()` and `system()` functions.
- `<conio.h>` for `kbhit()` (keypress detection).

---

## 📦 How to Run

### 🔧 Requirements:
- **Windows OS** (because the code uses `windows.h` and `system("cls")`).
- C++ compiler such as:
  - MinGW (g++)
  - MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++)
  - Code::Blocks
  - Dev-C++

### ▶️ Steps:
1. Copy the code into a `.cpp` file (e.g. `Project.cpp`).
2. Open your terminal or IDE.
3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ Project.cpp -o Project.exe
   ```
Run the program:

```bash
./Project.exe
```
